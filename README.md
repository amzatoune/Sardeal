# Sardeal
a discord bot that allows you to play a Texas Holdem poker game in a voice channel. The bot is expected to have a voice recognition service and a game service responsible to automatically detect players and manage a started game. The user interface is basically a text channel that accepts commands and managed by the bot user.
