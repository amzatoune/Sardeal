# Sardeal
Initially started with a fork of [slack-poker-bot](https://github.com/CharlieHess/slack-poker-bot); a quick rewrite for discordjs v12 of a simple bot for Slack written mainly using RxJs library.

## Description of a prospect
a discord bot that allows you to play a Texas Holdem poker game in a voice channel. The bot is expected to have a voice recognition service and a game service responsible to automatically detect players and manage a started game. The user interface is basically a text channel that accepts commands and managed by the bot user.

- [x] A positive attitude
- [x] Solve the timeout message bottlenecking phenomenon (yes it is a work of nature)
- [ ] Minimize the text messages for the game flow (reediting previous messages, make use of buttons and reactions)
- [ ] Adding a wake word for voice input.
